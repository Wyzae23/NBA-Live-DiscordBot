# NBA Live Discord Bot

The main functionality is to bring aggregated statistics of real-time NBA game statistics directly into a discord server. 
This functionality is designed to cater to basketball enthusiasts, sports analysts, and fantasy league players who seek up-to-the-minute information from the NBA world. Looking for aggregated statistics is slow. I wanted to make it more convenient and faster.

## Features

Right now one of the main features is:

!daily - returns the "top 5 fantasy players (most points based off ESPN's system)"  for each game played on the current date


## Getting Started

will update soon
